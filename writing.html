			Just leaving these nice words by other people here for now.
			<h5>FARGO</h5>
			"And for what? For a little bit of money. There's more to life than a little money, you know. Don't you know that? And here ya are, and it's a beautiful day. Well, I just don't understand it."
			<h5>CAT'S CRADLE</h5>
			"Life is a garden, not a road. We enter and exit through the same gate. Wandering, where we go matters less than what we notice."
