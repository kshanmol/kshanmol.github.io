There are several good reasons to blog. 
1. It gives you a place where you can produce content. 
2. It allows you to have a presence on the internet. 
3. If used regularly, it gives you a historical log of you as a person - your interests, opinions and creations. 

To me personally perhaps the third reason is the most interesting. 

With this, I begin.
