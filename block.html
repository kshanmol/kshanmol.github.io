		<p> Hi buddy, <br/> Looks like you're bored and have an impulse to consume something. But that won't give you any real satisfaction. </p>
		<p> 
		If you have the time, here is a bunch of things you could do instead
		<ul style="font-size: 1.4em">
			<li> Write something? <a href="https://roamresearch.com/#/app/kshanmol">Rough </a> or maybe even <a href="writing.html">share</a> something. </li>
			<li> Make one small piece of pixel or generative art! </li>
			<li> Practice some <a href="http://www.4clojure.com/problems"> Clojure?</a> </li> 
		</ul>
		If you were just looking for a quick break, maybe do one of these instead?
		<ul style="font-size: 1.4em">
			<li> Get some water or coffee </li>
			<li> Find someone to talk to </li>
			<li> Take a walk </li>
			<li> Meditate </li>
		</ul>
		Trust me, these have worked out well for you in the past :)
